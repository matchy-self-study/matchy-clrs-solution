\begin{homeworkProblem}
A \textbf{palindrome} is a nonempty string over some alphabet that reads the
same forward and backward. Examples of palindromes are all strings of length 1,
$civic$, $racecar$ and $aibohphobia$ (fear of palindromes). \\
Give an efficient algorithm to find the longest palindrome that is a subsequence
of a given input string. For example, given the input $character$, your algorithm
should return $carac$. What is the running time of your algorithm?
