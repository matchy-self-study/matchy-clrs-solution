\begin{homeworkProblem}
Consider inserting the keys $10, 22, 31, 4, 15, 28, 17, 88, 59$ into a hash
table of length $m = 11$ using open addressing with the auxiliary hash function
$h'(k) = k$. Illustrate the result of inserting these kes using linear probing,
using quadratic probing with $c_1 = 1$ and $c_2 = 3$, and using double hashing
with $h_1(k) = k$ and $h_2(k) = 1 + (k \mod(m - 1))$.
