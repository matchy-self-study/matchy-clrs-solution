# CHAPTER 1: The Role of Algorithms in Computing

This chapter will familiarize you with the framework we shall use throughout the book to think about the design and analysis of algorithms. It is self-contained, but it does include several references to material that will be introduced in Part I.

We begin with a discussion of computational problems in general and of the algorithms needed to solve them, with the problem of sorting as our running example. We introduce a "pseudocode" that should be familiar to readers who have done computer programming to show how we shall specify our algorithms. Insertion sort, a simple sorting algorithm, serves as an initial example. We analyze the running time of insertion sort, introducing a notation that focuses on how that time increases with the number of items to be sorted. We also introduce the divide-and-conquer approach to the design of algorithms and use it to develop an algorithm called merge sort. We end with a comparison of the two sorting algorithms.
